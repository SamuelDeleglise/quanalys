# Version 0.7.0. What's new?

## Quickly:

- List of str and object can also be saved.
- Functions can be saved.
- AttrDict has find and output methods.
- Short way to call enumerate(loop(...)) -> loop.enum(...).

## List of str and object can also be saved

Any list that can be converted to json can be saved now.
Examples:

```python
['a', 'b', 'c']
['a', 'b', {'p1': 'c', 'p2': 'd'}]
['a', 'b', [1, 2, 3]]
```

## Functions can be saved

It's possible to save a simple function now.

```python
aqm.acquisition_cell('simple_sine')

def acquire_data(size):
    import numpy as np
    x = np.linspace(0, 10*np.pi, size)
    y = np.sin(x)
    return x, y

aqm.save_acquisition(acquire_data=acquire_data);
```

```python
aqm.analysis_cell(acquisition_name=r"^simple_\w")
aqm.d.acquire_data(101)
```

They are save as a string inside the h5 file and evaluated on the first call (not on the load).

## AttrDict has find and output methods

AttrDict is a class used when config file is loaded. It's classical dict, but with possibility to access items as attribute.

Now you can find items inside dict and output values.

### Find

```python
data =  AttrDict({'param_1': 'value1', 'param_2': 'value2'})
data.find('param') # -> ('param_1', 'value1')
data.find_all('param') # -> [('param_1', 'value1'), ('param_2', 'value2')]
```

### Output

The save logic as `parse_config_str` function.

```python
data =  AttrDict({'param_1': 123.43})

data.output(["param_1"]) # -> param_1 = 123.43
data.output(["param_1__m/s__1f"]) # -> param_1 = 123.4 (m/s)
```

## Short way to call enumerate(loop(...)) -> loop.enum(...)

As easy as title says. No need to call enumerate on loop just use `loop.enum(...)`

```python
aqm.acquisition_cell('simple_sine')

aqm['some_loop'] = loop = AcquisitionLoop()

for i, q in loop.enum(1, 5, .5):
    loop.append(x=i, y=q)
```

```python
aqm.analysis_cell(acquisition_name=r"^simple_\w")
aqm.d.some_loop.x  # -> [0., 1., 2., 3.]
aqm.d.some_loop.y  # -> [1. , 1.5, 2. , 2.5]
```

## Minor features

- Fix saving complex numbers inside AcquisitionLoop
